# CRUD Application using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application implemented in Node.js with Express.js as the web framework, MongoDB as the database, and EJS as the template engine. The application allows users to manage items with a name and description.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

 
   git clone  https://github.com/geniusrks1/CURDwithRESTFULlrouting.git
   cd your-repo
 

2. Install dependencies:


   npm install
  

3. Set up the MongoDB database:

   - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your system.
   - Create a new MongoDB database and note its connection URI.
   - Replace the `MONGODB_URI` variable in `app.js` with your MongoDB connection URI.

4. Start the application:

  
   node app.js


5. Access the application:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- View a list of items with their names and descriptions.
- Add new items to the list.
- Edit existing items in the list.
- Delete items from the list.

## File Structure

The project has the following file structure:

- `app.js`: The main server file where the Express.js application is set up, and the routes are defined.
- `views/`: Contains the EJS templates for rendering HTML pages.
  - `index.ejs`: Displays the list of items.
  - `new.ejs`: Provides a form to add a new item.
  - `edit.ejs`: Provides a form to edit an existing item.

## RESTful Routing

The application follows RESTful routing principles for managing items:

- `GET /items`: View all items (Index).
- `GET /items/new`: Display a form to add a new item (New).
- `POST /items`: Add a new item (Create).
- `GET /items/:id/edit`: Display a form to edit an item (Edit).
- `PUT /items/:id`: Update an item (Update).
- `DELETE /items/:id`: Delete an item (Destroy).
